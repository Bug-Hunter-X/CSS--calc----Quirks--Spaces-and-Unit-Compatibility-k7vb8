The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it has some quirks.  One uncommon error is forgetting to include spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px);` will result in an error, whereas `width: calc(100% - 10px);` will work correctly.  Another less obvious issue is using incompatible units within a single calculation. For example, `height: calc(100px + 2em);` might render unexpectedly across different font sizes; the calculation might not happen as expected.
